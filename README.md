# The App
Using giphy.com's API, a selection of gifs featuring musical artists are presented when a button is pushed. The user also has the option of creating their own buttons to call up gifs of their choice.

# Overiew
This app uses an API key from the website GIPHY.com to call 10 gifs related to the subject assigned to the button. It also allows the user to create their own button by submitting a subject via text-box and submit button. 
The app is responive. Additional clicks of a button will produce another selection of ten gifs. Each gif is presented with the following metadata: title, type, and url.

# Operating Instruction
As soon as the page loads, the user is free to push any of the buttons, all of them labeled with a different musical arist.

Ten gifs will appear, below the buttons, each of them corresponding to the named artist on the button that was pushed. When another button is pushed, another set of ten gifs appears. If the user so chooses, they may enter the name of an artist in to the search field, press the button labeled "What's your jam?". A button, bearing the name of the artist that was typed in to the search field , appears at the bottom of the rows of buttons. More buttons, and gifs, can be created in this manner.
